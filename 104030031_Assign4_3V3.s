;To check if it is possible to achieve a CPI of 1 for this code sample, the loops
;were opened and not used. The loops were only being performed a few times
;so this made sense. The other instructions associated with the
;loops were also removed such as bne, sltiu, beq.

;THe CPI of 1 was not acheived and through this it is assumed it is not possible
;due to the nature of instructions such as lw, sw, ori, addiu and xor 
;which contribute to the CPI value

;The number of cycles were reduced drastically compared to part 2. 
;There are 0 RAW stalls due to the xor instruction working without delay.

;Comparitively the CPI still lower than part 1 and part 2

;Enable forwarding
;Cycles: 50
;Instructions: 45
;CPI: 1.111
;RAW Stalls: 0

;Some Things to Note
;CPI = (Cycles-5)/Instructions
;Branch Stalls = Cycles - Instruction - Raw Stalls - 5
;CPI = (50-5)/45 = 1 ---> Meaning accurate CPI of 1 is achievable through this method
;Branch Stalls = 0
